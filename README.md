## Welcome to the team Self Driving in Special Weather page

# Problem

The self-driving car is one of the hottest topic in AI industry. There are many players including [Waymo](https://waymo.com), [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com) and [Toyota](http://www.toyota.co.jp/jpn/tech/automated_driving/). One of the difficulties in learning process is adopting to any road conditions, though it is costly to gather all possible data.  

# Our solution

Generating special weathers (e.g., rainy, night, snow, ...) from a single situation. For example, to get a rainy image from the clear weather, we add CG particles (rain drops) and map the appropriate texture onto road surface. This 3D data augmentation will enhance the capability of self-driving car.
